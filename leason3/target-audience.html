            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This site has been designed to accommodate owners of small or medium type businesses that are thinking of
                expanding their business into the community. Such business owners that I have taken into consideration
                of are supermarket, mall, and wholesale business owners. In addition, its purpose is to connect these
                business owners to have more versatility in the community in terms of collaboration. </p>

                <p>Tatenda Mvumba</p>
                <p>Tatenda is a small business owner of a grocery shop, as he sells different sorts of food appliances, but
                    recently he has been trying to increase his stock by adding in kitchen utensils to his business.</p>

                <p>Euston runs what I may say is a medium-growing wholesale business as he sales things that are entirely
                    focused or centralised on home appliances and as well as groceries as well. </p>
